# Concrete-Crack-Classifier
## Objective:
- This GitHub repository is dedicated to the development of a deep learning model for detecting cracks in concrete structures. The primary objective is to leverage the power of deep neural networks to accurately identify and classify cracks in images of concrete surfaces. The model focuses on enhancing the efficiency of concrete crack detection, which is crucial for infrastructure maintenance and safety.
